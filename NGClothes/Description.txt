Hello! 
I'm really glad that you bought my Interior Customizing System! :)
Things you have to know to be able to run the system:
- You have to change the MySQL datas in the server sided scripts!
- Two element datas have to be applied to the player:
	- "dbid": this is a number that defines the player, the players permanent id
	- "money": the player money, stored in element data, to be able to buy the interior
- Set up properly the MySQL table that I sent

Enjoy my script! :))
